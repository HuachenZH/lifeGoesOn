Difficulties encounterd
- error: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe9 in position 7329: invalid continuation byte
  i was trying to convert bytes to string.
  Solution found on stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19699367/for-line-in-results-in-unicodedecodeerror-utf-8-codec-cant-decode-byte
  The correct encoding was: "ISO-8859-1"



Try not to stackoverflow next time
- bytes to string
  $ b'this is bytes'.decode('utf-8')
  or
  $ str(b'this is bytes', 'utf-8')
  where 'utf-8' is the encoding/decoding format. It can be something else.

- send request to an url and get response
  There are several ways to do so:
  - use urlopen to fetch the website directly
    $ import urllib.request
    $ with urllib.requst.urlopen('https://www.google.com') as response:
    $     html = response.read() # html will be bytes
  - create a request object, Request, then use urlopen to open the request object
    $ import urllib.request
    $ req = urllib.request.Request('https://www.google.com')
    $ with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as response:
    $     html = response.read()
  - use the requests library (seen before with rootme)
    $ import requests
    $ resp = requests.get('https://www.google.com').text
    where text is an attribute of the requests Response object. Other attributes:
